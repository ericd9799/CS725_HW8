# Original Chart
The chart selected for critique and redesign is chart 2 - paired column chart.

The chart is comprised of point marks, and length channel. The vertical spatial position represents the category of ethnicities, and horiztonal spatial position represents the percentage of families where at least one member is unemployed. Color hue is an identity channel used to categorize the ethnicities. In addition, bar chart glpyh is used to be able to present the finding for each year.

The goal of the chart is to present the percentage of families where there is at least on member unemployed for 4 ethnicities over 10 years. I assume we would want to compare the change in umemployment rate between and among the ethnicities.

# Critique
If I need to compare the change among one ethnicity, this would be challenging because of the distance between bars and the amount of bars. For example, if I am trying to compare the percent difference for white families between 2004 and 2014, I would need to memorize the height of the bar. Also, from a quick glance the 2 heights look the same.

The colormap selected for does not pass the guideline of do it right in black and white. If the graph is printed in black-and-white, it is hard to tell apart the categories.
