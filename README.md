**Eric Diep, CS725 - Homework 8**

# Original Chart
The chart selected for critique and redesign is chart 2 - paired column chart.

The chart is comprised of point marks, and length channel. The vertical spatial position represents the category of ethnicities, and horiztonal spatial position represents the percentage of families where at least one member is unemployed. Color hue is an identity channel used to categorize the ethnicities. In addition, bar chart glpyh is used to be able to present the finding for each year.

The goal of the chart is to present the percentage of families where there is at least on member unemployed for 4 ethnicities over 10 years. I assume we would want to compare the change in umemployment rate between and among the ethnicities.

# Critique
If I need to compare the change among one ethnicity, this would be challenging because of the distance between bars and the amount of bars. For example, if I am trying to compare the percent difference for white families between 2004 and 2014, I would need to memorize the height of the bar. Also, from a quick glance the 2 heights look the same.

In the image below, I took the original chart and applied grayscale to the image. As seen, it is hard to tell apart certain categories. The colormap selected for does not pass the guideline of do it right in black and white.

# Analysis
The provided dataset is a table with the rows being year, and the columns being the ethnicities. The percentage of families with at least one member unemployed are populated within the fields.

# Alternate
Below is an alternate to the original graph. The idiom used is a connected scatterplot. Point marks are used to plot values, and line marks are used to connect the points to show temporal order. The vertical spatial position represents the year, and the horizontal spatial position represents the percentage value. Originally, the y-axis started at 0, but this left unused space. Thus, I decided to start the y-axis at 4. I also used Color Brewer tool to select colors that would stand out if the graph is converted to black-and-white.

I choose to use the connected scatterplot idiom because this allowed for all the graphs to be in one chart. Also, we are able to compare values between and within groups much easier. With the lines connecting the points, we are able to spot trends and features much easier. We are able to pinpoint plateaus, and dramatic increase or decreases in the graphs.
